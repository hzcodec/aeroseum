Project name:    X-Plane Flight Instrument Controller



Aim of project:  The aim of the project is to build both hardware and software for flight
                 instruments connected to X-Plane 10.
                
                 The software will be developed in C for Raspberry Pi.
                 The software will receive flight data from X-Plane 10.  Intepret the data and then
                 control the flight instruments.
                  
                 The flight instruments will be using servo motors in order to show the actual reading.

                 To control the servo motors a Servo Motor Controller from Adafruit will be used. 
                 The type will be 16-Channel I2C Servo Controller.

                 The flight instruments it self need to be scratch build.
